## About Me
Hello! I'm Anna Isabel John, a postgraduate student passionate about cybersecurity, software development, and machine learning. I thrive on creating innovative solutions to complex problems and am constantly seeking to learn new technologies and enhance my skills.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### AI-Enabled Phishing Detection Model
- **Description**: The AI-enabled phishing detection model aims to identify phishing websites with high precision and recall by leveraging ensemble learning techniques. It combines multiple base classifiers to improve overall performance and reliability.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn
- **Features**: 
  - Ensemble learning techniques including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.
  - Extensive data preprocessing including cleaning, scaling, and feature selection.
  - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

### CVD Risk Prediction using AI Analysis of Retinal Images
- **Description**: The CVD risk prediction project utilizes AI analysis of retinal images to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to extract features from retinal images and classify patients into different risk categories.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Jupyter Notebooks
- **Features**:
  - Utilization of CNNs for feature extraction and classification.
  - Preprocessing techniques for enhancing retinal image quality and reducing noise.
  - Integration of AI analysis with traditional risk assessment methods for comprehensive CVD risk prediction.
