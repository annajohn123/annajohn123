## About Me
Hello! I'm Anna Isabel John, a postgraduate student passionate about cybersecurity, software development, and machine learning. I thrive on creating innovative solutions to complex problems and am constantly seeking to learn new technologies and enhance my skills.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### AI-Enabled Phishing Detection Model
- **Description**: The AI-enabled phishing detection model aims to identify phishing websites with high precision and recall by leveraging ensemble learning techniques. It combines multiple base classifiers to improve overall performance and reliability.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn
- **Features**: 
  - Ensemble learning techniques including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.
  - Extensive data preprocessing including cleaning, scaling, and feature selection.
  - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

### CVD Risk Prediction using AI Analysis of Retinal Images
- **Description**: The CVD risk prediction project utilizes AI analysis of retinal images to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to extract features from retinal images and classify patients into different risk categories.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Jupyter Notebooks
- **Features**:
  - Utilization of CNNs for feature extraction and classification.
  - Preprocessing techniques for enhancing retinal image quality and reducing noise.
  - Integration of AI analysis with traditional risk assessment methods for comprehensive CVD risk prediction.

  ### Decentralized Image Upload and Sharing
- **Description**:This project facilitates decentralized image upload and sharing on the blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the front-end interface. It enables users to securely upload images to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and share access with specified users through smart contract functionality.

- **Technologies Used**:- **Solidity:** Smart contract development for ownership and access control.
- **React:** Front-end interface for uploading images and managing access.
- **IPFS:** Decentralized storage protocol for hosting uploaded images.
- **Features**:
 - Decentralized Storage: Images are uploaded to IPFS, ensuring decentralized and immutable storage.
- Smart Contract: Utilizes Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for access control and ownership management.
- Access Control: Users can grant or revoke access to their uploaded images to specific individuals through the smart contract.
